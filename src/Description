Assignment 1:
 For a given N, prints the sum of even and odd integers of the first N natural numbers.
 Example 1:
 	Input:
 	N = 1
 	Output:
 	0 1
 	Explanation:
 	Natural numbers less than 1 are only 1.
 	So the sum of even number = 0.
 	and the sum of odd number = 1

Assignment 2:
Given two arrays key[] and arr[] of size N and a key s. Each key[i] and arr[i] form a key-value pair.
Find if the value of S in the N key-value pairs.

Example:1
	Input: n = 3
	keys = {sak, var, vijay}
	arr = {5, 7, 3}
	s = sak
	Output: 5
	Explanation: The key is present in the map.
	So its corresponding value is returned which
	is 5.
